SumToZero app
====

This is a demo web application which demonstrates usage of several technologies and libraries.

The web view consists of:
* an input which expects a valid Javascript array of numbers,
* display of the number of all sub-arrays of the input array whose elements sum up to 0,
* basic visualization of such sub-arrays.

The following technologies/libraries have been used:

* AngularJS
* TypeScript
* Bootstrap
* animate.css
* dev tools including gulp

# Usage

* `git clone https://github.com/njoy89/sumToZero.git`
* `npm install`
* launch the browser and go to the `http://localhost:8080/` page. The port is configurable in the `config.json` file.

# Deployment

The web app is already deployed on http://sum-to-zero.herokuapp.com/.
